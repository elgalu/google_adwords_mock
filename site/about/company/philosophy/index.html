              We first wrote these “10 things” when Google was just a few years old. From time to
              time we revisit this list to see if it still holds true. We hope it does—and you can

                <p>
                  Since the beginning, we’ve focused on providing the best user experience
                  possible. Whether we’re designing a new Internet browser or a new tweak to the
                  look of the homepage, we take great care to ensure that they will ultimately
                  serve <strong>you</strong>, rather than our own internal goal or bottom line. Our
                  homepage interface is clear and simple, and pages load instantly. Placement in
                  search results is never sold to anyone, and advertising is not only clearly
                  marked as such, it offers relevant content and is not distracting. And when we
                  build new tools and applications, we believe they should work so well you don’t
                  have to consider how they might have been designed differently.

                <p>
                  We do search. With one of the world’s largest research groups focused exclusively
                  on solving search problems, we know what we do well, and how we could do it
                  better. Through continued iteration on difficult problems, we’ve been able to
                  solve complex issues and provide continuous improvements to a service that
                  already makes finding information a fast and seamless experience for millions of
                  people. Our dedication to improving search helps us apply what we’ve learned to
                  new products, like Gmail and Google Maps. Our hope is to bring the power of
                  search to previously unexplored areas, and to help people access and use even
                  more of the ever-expanding information in their lives.

                  We know your time is valuable, so when you’re seeking an answer on the web you
                  want it right away–and we aim to please. We may be the only people in the world
                  who can say our goal is to have people leave our website as quickly as possible.
                  By shaving excess bits and bytes from our pages and increasing the efficiency of
                  our serving environment, we’ve broken our own speed records many times over, so
                  that the average response time on a search result is a fraction of a second. We
                  keep speed in mind with each new product we release, whether it’s a mobile
                  application or Google Chrome, a browser designed to be fast enough for the modern
                  web. And we continue to work on making it all go even faster.

                  Google search works because it relies on the millions of individuals posting
                  links on websites to help determine which other sites offer content of value. We
                  assess the importance of every web page using more than 200 signals and a variety
                  of techniques, including our patented PageRank™ algorithm, which analyzes which
                  sites have been “voted” to be the best sources of information by other pages
                  across the web. As the web gets bigger, this approach actually improves, as each
                  new site is another point of information and another vote to be counted. In the
                  same vein, we are active in open source software development, where innovation
                  takes place through the collective effort of many programmers.

                  The world is increasingly mobile: people want access to information wherever they
                  are, whenever they need it. We’re pioneering new technologies and offering new
                  solutions for mobile services that help people all over the globe to do any
                  number of tasks on their phone, from checking email and calendar events to
                  watching videos, not to mention the several different ways to access Google
                  search on a phone. In addition, we’re hoping to fuel greater innovation for
                  mobile users everywhere with Android, a free, open source mobile platform.
                  Android brings the openness that shaped the Internet to the mobile world. Not
                  only does Android benefit consumers, who have more choice and innovative new
                  mobile experiences, but it opens up revenue opportunities for carriers,
                  manufacturers and developers.

                  Google is a business. The revenue we generate is derived from offering search
                  technology to companies and from the sale of advertising displayed on our site
                  and on other sites across the web. Hundreds of thousands of advertisers worldwide
                  use AdWords to promote their products; hundreds of thousands of publishers take
                  advantage of our AdSense program to deliver ads relevant to their site content.
                  To ensure that we’re ultimately serving all our users (whether they are
                  advertisers or not), we have a set of guiding principles for our advertising
                  programs and practices:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      We don’t allow ads to be displayed on our results pages unless they are
                      relevant where they are shown. And we firmly believe that ads can provide
                      useful information if, and only if, they are relevant to what you wish to
                      find–so it’s possible that certain searches won’t lead to any ads at all.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      We believe that advertising can be effective without being flashy. We don’t
                      accept pop–up advertising, which interferes with your ability to see the
                      content you’ve requested. We’ve found that text ads that are relevant to the
                      person reading them draw much higher clickthrough rates than ads appearing
                      randomly. Any advertiser, whether small or large, can take advantage of this
                      highly targeted medium.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                    <p>
                      Advertising on Google is always clearly identified as a “Sponsored Link,” so
                      it does not compromise the integrity of our search results. We never
                      manipulate rankings to put our partners higher in our search results and no
                      one can buy better PageRank. Our users trust our objectivity and no
                      short-term gain could ever justify breaching that trust.

                  Once we’d indexed more of the HTML pages on the Internet than any other search
                  service, our engineers turned their attention to information that was not as
                  readily accessible. Sometimes it was just a matter of integrating new databases
                  into search, such as adding a phone number and address lookup and a business
                  directory. Other efforts required a bit more creativity, like adding the ability
                  to search news archives, patents, academic journals, billions of images and
                  millions of books. And our researchers continue looking into ways to bring all
                  the world’s information to people seeking answers.

                <p>
                  Our company was founded in California, but our mission is to facilitate access to
                  information for the entire world, and in every language. To that end, we have
                  offices in more than 60 countries, maintain more than 180 Internet domains, and
                  serve more than half of our results to people living outside the United States.
                  We offer Google’s search interface in more than 130 languages, offer people the
                  ability to restrict results to content written in their own language, and aim to
                  provide the rest of our applications and products in as many languages and
                  <a href="/accessibility/">accessible formats</a> as possible. Using our
                  translation tools, people can discover content written on the other side of the
                  world in languages they don’t speak. With these tools and the help of volunteer
                  translators, we have been able to greatly improve both the variety and quality of
                  services we can offer in even the most far–flung corners of the globe.

                  Our founders built Google around the idea that work should be challenging, and
                  the challenge should be fun. We believe that great, creative things are more
                  likely to happen with the right company culture–and that doesn’t just mean lava
                  lamps and rubber balls. There is an emphasis on team achievements and pride in
                  individual accomplishments that contribute to our overall success. We put great
                  stock in our employees–energetic, passionate people from diverse backgrounds with
                  creative approaches to work, play and life. Our atmosphere may be casual, but as
                  new ideas emerge in a café line, at a team meeting or at the gym, they are
                  traded, tested and put into practice with dizzying speed–and they may be the
                  launch pad for a new project destined for worldwide use.

                <p>
                  We see being great at something as a starting point, not an endpoint. We set
                  ourselves goals we know we can’t reach yet, because we know that by stretching to
                  meet them we can get further than we expected. Through innovation and iteration,
                  we aim to take things that work well and improve upon them in unexpected ways.
                  For example, when one of our engineers saw that search worked well for properly
                  spelled words, he wondered about how it handled typos. That led him to create an
                  intuitive and more helpful spell checker.

                  Even if you don’t know exactly what you’re looking for, finding an answer on the
                  web is our problem, not yours. We try to anticipate needs not yet articulated by
                  our global audience, and meet them with products and services that set new
                  standards. When we launched Gmail, it had more storage space than any email
                  service available. In retrospect offering that seems obvious–but that’s because
                  now we have new standards for email storage. Those are the kinds of changes we
                  seek to make, and we’re always looking for new places where we can make a
                  difference. Ultimately, our constant dissatisfaction with the way things are
                  becomes the driving force behind everything we do.
